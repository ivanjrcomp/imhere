## **Summary**

This is a simple React Native project designed to help organizers maintain an record of attendee presence at an event, providing a convenient solution for tracking and managing attendance, eliminating the need for manual paper-based systems. The system allows event organizers to add attendees and register their presence with just a few clicks.

## **Solution**

In this project, I chose to build a simple React Native solution using Expo (Managed Workflow) as a framework, running with Expo Go. This choice facilitates the creation of solutions for different devices without the need to worry about configuring the CLI for each mobile operating system.

The main objective of this project is to utilize React Native to build a solution that can run on Android and iOS systems in a straightforward manner. As a learning project, my focus is not on a complex solution but on grasping fundamental concepts. For example, I aimed to deepen my understanding of Hooks (useState, immutability, state, and TextInput), rendering, asynchronous flow, JSX, React Components (such as TextInput, TouchableOpacity, StatusBar, ScrollView, and FlatList), custom components, and handling alerts.

In summary, this project provided me with a valuable learning experience as I utilized React Native and Expo (Managed Workflow) to create a user-friendly solution for Android and iOS devices. I hope that my work here can be useful to others and inspire them to further explore these tools.

## **Requirements**

- Node.JS: 18.14.0
    - NPM Package: 9.6.6

## **Quickstart**

Below are the step-by-step instructions for running the project in your emulator or phone:

1. Install the Expo Go app on your iOS or Android phone and connect to the same wireless network as your computer. On Android, use the Expo Go app to scan the QR code from your terminal to open your project. On iOS, use the built-in QR code scanner of the default iOS Camera app. You also can execute the project if you have an emulator. 
2. After installing Expo Go on the emulator or on your phone, run the following command to start the Expo development server to run the application:<br />
    + `npx expo start`
